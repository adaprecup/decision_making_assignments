# Final Case Study â€“ Flood Risk Management for the IJssel River - EPA141

This repository contains all files and code used to conduct the final project for the course "Model-Based Decision Making" in the EPA Master's Programme. The project involves analyzing flood risk management strategies for the IJssel River region using robust decision-making under uncertainty.


## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Develop and evaluate policy strategies (e.g., dike heightening, Room for the River, Early Warning Systems)
- Apply techniques such as RDM, scenario discovery, and multi-objective optimization
- Provide actionable advice to the Delta Programme and critically reflect on model use in policy

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This model is developed for exploratory analysis only and is not calibrated for real-world prediction. It supports strategy comparison and stakeholder reflection under uncertainty.

Results should be interpreted in conjunction with political, economic, and environmental context provided in the project reflection and report.
